          A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled
          <br />
          vehicle used to carry a payload from Earth's surface to
          <br />
          space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X
          <br />
          carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing
          <br />
          150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the
          <br />
          launch pad!

          A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or
          <br />
          receiving) spacecraft, by analogy to the seaport for ships
          <br />
          or airport for aircraft. Based in the famous Cape
          <br />
          Canaveral, our spaceport is ideally situated to take
          <br />
          advantage of the Earthâ€™s rotation for launch.

          <br />
          atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where you'll

          spend your time during the flight. It includes a space
          <br />
          gym, cinema, and plenty of other activities to keep you
          <br />
          entertained.
